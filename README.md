 <strong>Brief Description about the project
 <br>

Angular project with login and local storage

This project demonstrates how to create an Angular project where the user can login and the login credentials are stored in local storage.

The project uses a template-driven form for the login form. When the user submits the form, the login credentials are validated against a hardcoded user list. If the credentials are valid, the user is logged in and the login credentials are stored in local storage.

The user can then access the protected pages of the application. If the user logs out, the login credentials are removed from local storage.

The project also includes a simple logout component that allows the user to log out of the application.

This project is a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn how to create an Angular project with login and local storage.
